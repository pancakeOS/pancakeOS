# PancakeOS



## About PancakeOS
We are not a actual OS that you can put onto a USB stick and boot since making a actual OS in Lua is quite stupid idea.

What this actually is a OS made with [LOVE](https://love2d.org/) since this was originally a Scratch project but by a different name (btw using it is a little broken cause yea it was made like 3 years ago)
MORE COMING SOON
